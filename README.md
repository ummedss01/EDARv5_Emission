# EDARv5 Anthropogenic Emission for Atmospheric Chemistry Transport Modeling

##project overview
I have make ready to use EDGARv5 anthropogenic emissions for the atmospheric chemistry transport model (WRF-chem, GEOS-Chem, CMAQ, etc).The sectors and pollutants specific emission are avaible in EDGAR site. I have not included the large scale fire in final emission so you can used as per choice from differrent platform like FINN, GFED etc.

##Data source 
The sector and pollutnts specific emission accose the globe is estimated by joint eropian commition under Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research using bottom up method. [EDGARv5](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_ap50)

##Tools
 - schell script for data dowload
 - Python for data anlysis
 - QGIS for Visualization
